# 2D Finite Element Method (FEM)
FEM is a numerical method used to approximate the solution of boundary and initial value problems characterized by partial differential equations. Used to find the temperature distribution, tensile strength of a material and so on.

## Usage
Type in the following command in terminal:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```
Input the necessary filenames and boundary conditions.

## Algorithm
Create a 2D mesh using triangle shell meshes. Set the boundary conditions ($0^{o}C$ and $100^{o}C$ nodes)
