# Gauss Elimination
Used to find the solution of linear simultaneous equations arising in engineering problems. Equations are solved by elimination procedure of the unknowns succesively

## Usage
Type in the following command in the terminal:
```bash
gcc filename.c -lm
```
```bash
./a.out
```
Input all the necessary initial matrix information and the solution will be shown. NOTE: The matrix is in the form of

$$ Ax = b $$

## Algorithm
1. Input A,b
2. Forward Elimination
3. Backwards Substitution
4. Output of solution x
