# Gauss-Seidel Method
This is a method which takes Jacobi's Method one step further and converges faster.

## Usage
Type in the following commands in terminal:
```bash
gcc filename.c -lm
```
```bash
./a.out
```
Input the necessary matrix values. NOTE: Matrix is in the form of

$$Ax = b$$

If gnuplot is not installed, type in the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install gnuplot
```

## Algorithm
Same as Gauss-Jacobi method, except that it utilizes the updated values for calculation.
