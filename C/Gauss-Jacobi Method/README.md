# Gauss-Jacobi Method
This is one of the iterative methods for approximating the solution of a system of n linear equations in n variables. The process is iterated until it converges. Jacobi Method is also known as the simultaneous displacement method.

## Usage
Type in the following commands in terminal:
```bash
gcc filename.c -lm
```
```bash
./a.out
```
Input the necessary matrix values. NOTE: Matrix is in the form of 
$$ Ax = b $$
